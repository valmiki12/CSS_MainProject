                        legend at this point. Listing his resume here would be a very long process, so we’re just going
                        to skip it. Then you’ve got Dr. Dre who’s probably the most successful artist/businessman to
                        ever come out of hip-hop. He’s been directly involved in every great era of hip-hop since N.W.A.
                        Afterwards he found Eminem and now he’s backing Kendrick Lamar, so it’s safe to say the guy
                        knows what he’s doing when it comes to music.</td>
